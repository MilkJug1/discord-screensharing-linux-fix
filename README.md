# discord-screensharing-linux-fix
This is an opensource project that is going to be fixing an issue with discord on linux distros, it will show all screens instead of one even if you make it. My theory is that it has something to do with either discord detecting monitors or how linux/gnu detects monitors, this is going to be a hard task with one person because I don't know where to start but you can help if you want because this is opensource
